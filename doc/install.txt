Installing TFM Voting

Overview
	To install TFM voting, you will need to initialize both a database and upload the 
	web folder to your PHP enabled web server.  

Initializing the Database
	To set up the database, create a blank schema and user to access the new schema.
	These can be named however you want, just modify the contents of web/config.php
	DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_HOST to match the database name, 
	user name, user password, and MySQL server address that you have configured. 
	Finally, run the TFM_Structure.sql script in your database to set up the initial 
	layout of tables.

Installing the Web Interface
	To install the web interface, put the contents of the web folder on your server. 	After this, you should password protect (using basic HTTP authentication) the 	admin folder to restrict administrator privileges. The vote folder may also be 
	protected in a similar manner to provide restricted voting and viewing of
	restricted projects. 

Notes
	When you wish to change the voting criteria for a project set, you must edit the 
	config.php file before creating the project set.  The project set will then 
	inherit the changed criteria while all after will still maintain their previous
	criteria. This method will hopefully be changed in future versions of the system.
