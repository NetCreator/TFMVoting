Installing TFM Voting

Overview
	To install TFM voting, you will need to initialize both a database and upload the 
	web folder to your PHP enabled web server.  

Initializing the Database

Installing the Web Interface
	To install the web interface, simply edit the values of the config.php file in the
	web folder in this repository and then put the entire web folder on your server. 
	After this, you should password protect (using the web server's functionality) the
	admin folder to restrict administrator privileges. The vote folder may also be 
	protected in a similar manner to provide restricted voting and viewing of
	restricted projects. 

Notes
	When you wish to change the voting criteria for a project set, you must edit the 
	config.php file before creating the project set.  The project set will then 
	inherit the changed criteria while all after will still maintain their previous
	criteria.
